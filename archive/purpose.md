This folder is used to store older or less frequently accessed documents and files. Archiving helps to keep the main workspace organized and clutter-free, while still preserving important information for future reference. Files in this folder may include outdated reports, completed project files, historical data, and other materials that are not needed for daily operations but may be useful for long-term storage or record-keeping.
