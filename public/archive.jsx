                    Floppa Games. After that, it was replaced with a CRC check in the

                    12.3.4, and removed in Version 12.2.6. It was never shown on the site,
                    and only used internally for testing.

                    Games Version 7 has been lost, as the repositories were lost.

                    Games buttons. It was found during the transfer from Starry to Ijichi.

                <p>
                    There is an abandoned re-write of Space Cat Games called Space Cat
                    Games Version II. It was maintained for a short period of 2 months,
                    and was released once. It never went mainstream, and never replaced
                    Space Cat Games Version 11 (latest at the time).

                <p>
                    There is also a lost version of Space Cat Games Version 11, that was
                    known internally as "SPC Legacy". It was to be released when Space Cat
                    Games II went mainstream. It was never released, however, functions
                    relating to SPC Legacy can be found in the code.
