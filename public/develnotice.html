<h1>The shift to React.js, and changes in branching and committing.</h1>
<br>
<p>Yeah, this is an adhoc page. But it's here to explain the changes in branching and committing.
    Currently, all changes to be deployed are pushed to <code>main</code> branch. This will not change, however unused branches like <code>minimal</code> and
    <code>draft/summer-brook</code> will be deleted.

    The current working tree before the shift will be stored in a branch called <code>pre-react</code>. This branch will not be deleted, and will be used to revert to if necessary.
    The new working tree will live in <code>main</code>. 
    The <code>react</code> branch will be archived.


    Happy coding!
